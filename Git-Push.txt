OPTION 1 (BEST & CORRECT WAY – use this)

	Step 1: Create repository on GitHub

		Open https://github.com
		Click New repository
		Give name (example: my-project)
		Click Create repository
		❌ Do NOT add README, .gitignore, license

	Step 2: Open folder on your computer
		C:\Users\You\Desktop\MyFolder
                Right-click inside the folder → Open Terminal / Command Prompt

	Step 3: Run these commands ONE BY ONE
		git init
		git add .
		git commit -m "first commit"

	Step 4: Connect folder to GitHub
		Copy your repo URL from GitHub (looks like this):
		https://github.com/yourname/my-project.git

		Now run:
			git remote add origin https://github.com/yourname/my-project.git → only first time
			Example: git remote add origin https://github.com/G1thub-05/Spring-Project.git
			git branch -M main
			git push -u origin main

	Step 5: Done
		Refresh GitHub → your folder is uploaded

OPTION 2 (EASIEST – NO COMMANDS)

	If you don’t want commands:
		Open your GitHub repo
		Click Add file → Upload files
		Drag your folder
		Click Commit changes
		This works, but this is not real Git usage. Fine for beginners.
